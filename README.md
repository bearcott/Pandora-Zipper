Pandora-Zipper
==============

add meta tags to 28 songs from Pandora to zip download to your PC.

###How does it work?
Pandora Zipper is a PHP application that allows you to download songs that have been loaded using pandora's unofficial API.
The program first collects 28 song urls by cycling through the 6 skip limit that pandora has. This is done through an http request that recieves
4 songs per skip. (first 4 + 6*4 skips = 28)

The application then processes the information using php reader and applies metatags in both ID3 and ilst formats through PHP Reader. Once metadata
has been added, it is zipped and sent back to the browser for download.
